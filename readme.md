I made this proxy generator for people who want to try out cards from SW Destiny before buying them.

#CUSTOM DATABASE
If you downloaded the zip, you can provide your own database! Just get the cards.json from [here](http://swdestinydb.com/api/public/cards/), put it in the SWDestinyProxy folder, then change cards.json however you like! (Translations, custom cards, etc)

Trust in the force!
